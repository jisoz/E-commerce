When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT for that user 
using the secret key. The JWT contains information about the user 
(such as their username or user ID) and is signed using the secret key. When the
 user sends subsequent requests to the server, they include this JWT in the request, typically in the 
 Authorization header.

The server receives the JWT, verifies the 
signature using the secret key, and extracts the user's information from the 
token. If the signature is valid, the server considers the user authenticated and 
processes the request accordingly.

User Authentication:

When a user logs in, the server generates a JWT containing the user's ID or other identifying information.
This JWT is signed using a secret key known only to the server. This signature ensures that the token hasn't been tampered with.
Token Sent to Client:

The server sends the JWT back to the client, typically as a response to the login request.
The client receives the JWT and stores it, usually in local storage or a cookie.
Subsequent Requests:

For subsequent requests that require authentication, the client includes the JWT in the request, typically in the Authorization header.
The server receives the JWT, verifies the signature using the secret key, and extracts the user's ID or other information from the token.
If the signature is valid, the server considers the user authenticated and processes the request.
Expiration and Refresh:

JWTs can have an expiration time (exp claim) to limit their lifespan. After expiration, the token is no longer valid.
To handle expiration, the client can request a new JWT using a refresh token or by re-authenticating.
